There are many websites that make use of data structures and complex data for showing the content on their website. One easy and feasible way is to use artificial intelligence and data analysis to produce a machine learning algorithm that produces content based on users input. The input that user enters is then processed and categorized by the machine learning algorithm that makes the entire content of the website to show some dynamic way of content updation by adding and modifying some products or content based on user input entered one there by introducing the user to further more available options through the website. By making the content of the website dynamic there is always a high chance of users focusing on things that they want to consume more or purchase from options available. The CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks model) can be used in this process to achieve greater results. The machine algorithm generates some keywords based on some inputs by user (if exists) else the content is generated as it is predefined. The content generated by the machine learning algorithm can be accessed by API (application programming interfaces) from the backend.
